The_design_that_started_it_all
==============================
*The first app I designed but did not code and why I went to code school to learn to do it myself... oh yeah!*

The design impetus
-----
**We needed something different.** While working for a company that kept records in Excel, I pushed for developing a web application that would store, query, manage, and communicate data.  At this time I did not code but had design experience from my side graphic design business and quantitative analysis skills from being a research scientist.  Together, those skills allowed me to write this document that described what I wanted to see on the screen and what I wanted it to do. 

**I loved the process.**  I loved breaking things down into tiny, tiny pieces and finding mechanisms for relationships that would inform and make work easier.  I loved solving the problems that plagued the business and made the profit margins shrink due to time inefficiency. I loved it so much, I thought I should learn to code... I had to make more... I wanted to design software that solves problems and makes people's lives better.  Maybe people could be with their kids or be in their garden, or whatever, just one more time a year and be happier... and then wouldn't we all be a bit happier... a better community.  I know, blah, blah, blah, but I believe technology really can change the world. Just like the shovel did!

**This process was for me, it fit me.** Developing a web application became the perfect marriage of my brain's two seemingly disjunct sides.  Product Management is my corpus callosum.  It is why I went to code school and why I am an aspiring Product Manager.  

**Yes, this is a big doc.**  To take a look, feel free to download the doc.. as the 52 pager is beyond GitHub's capacity for display at this time.
